"""Unit tests for voice intent extraction from 'thinks aloud' text.

Tests the /api/voice/extract-intent endpoint logic using real text samples
observed from Gemini Live's 'thinks aloud' bug, where it narrates its intent
as text instead of emitting toolCall messages.

Runs against the real Gemini API (~2s per test).
